Some Flask related Examples 

## Flask in Notebook 

The Notebook is becoming / has become the most used tool by Data Scientists hence being able to run a Flaks App directly from a Notebook would be nice 

Even if it is not straightforward it is possible, in fact this [example](flask_in_notebook1.ipynb) shows how to make it using Python Threads and Popen and also redirecting the Flask Output in the console 

A test is also provided, using curl to access the Localhost Flask Port
